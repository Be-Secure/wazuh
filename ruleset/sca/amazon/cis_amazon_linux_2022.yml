  # 1.1.2.1 Ensure /tmp is a separate partition.
  - id: 31003
    title: "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexecoption on the mount, making /tmpuseless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuidprogram and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based. /tmp utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in the relevant entry in /etc/fstab."
    remediation: "First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp mount for your environment will be mounted at boot time. # systemctl unmask tmp.mount . For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/stab. Example using tmpfs with specific mount options: # tmpfs /tmp / tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 0 . Example using a volume or disk with specific mount options, The source location of the volumne or disk will vary depending on your environment: # <device> /tmp <fstype> defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0"

    description: "The /home directory is used to support disk storage needs of local users."
    rationale: "If the system is intended to support local users, create a separate partition for the /home directory to protect against resource exhaustion and restrict the type of files that can be stored under /home."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers.

    description: "Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter a password before being able to set command line boot parameters."
    rationale: "Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users from weakening security (e.g. turning off SELinux at boot time)."
    impact: 'If password protection is enabled, only the designated superuser can edit a Grub 2 menu item by pressing "e" or access the GRUB 2 command line by pressing "c". If GRUB 2 is set up to boot automatically to a password-protected menu entry the user has no option to back out of the password prompt to select another menu entry. Holding the SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username and password. If unable, the configuration files will have to be edited via the LiveCD or other means to fix the problem You can add --unrestricted to the menu entries to allow the system to boot without entering a password. Password will still be required to edit menu items.'

    rationale: "For unconfined processes, SELinux policy rules are applied, but policy rules exist that allow processes running in unconfined domains almost all access. Processes running in unconfined domains fall back to using DAC rules exclusively. If an unconfined process is compromised, SELinux does not prevent an attacker from gaining access to system resources and data, but of course, DAC rules are still used. SELinux is a security enhancement on top of DAC rules - it does not replace them."
    remediation: "Investigate any unconfined processes found during the audit action. They may need to have an existing security context assigned to them or a policy built for them. Occasionally certain daemons such as backup or centralized management software may require running unconfined. Any such software should be carefully analyzed and documented before such an exception is made."
